                For any other lack of candy, or instant gratification I would quarrel bitterly: 
                scraping, scratching, being a nunsance at court. This taffy was different, stuck on my teeth it made my molars click, 
                slightly pulling them out of place with each failed attempt to swallow.

                Alas, a new candy has come into bring joy to my life. Heath Bars, broken and distraught it collected the 
                ditritus that remained of me from the floor and molded me back into a man. My god. My god thank you for such a divine intervention.
